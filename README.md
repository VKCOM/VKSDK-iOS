# What is the SuperAppKit SDK?
The SuperAppKit SDK is a collection of libraries that will help:
- make any app a part of the VK ecosystem
- turn your app into a super app by integrating services into your app without having to put in any additional effort into development

The general module of the SDK is VK ID, a single platform for authentication and user registration in various VK ecosystem services.
